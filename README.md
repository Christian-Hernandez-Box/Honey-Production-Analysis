# Honey Production Analysis

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing honey production data using linear regression. The goal is to investigate the decline in honeybee populations and predict future trends based on historical data.

## Code Overview
The code includes the following steps:
1. Load the honey production dataset.
2. Calculate the average honey production per year.
3. Visualize the data using a scatter plot.
4. Create a linear regression model and fit it to the data.
5. Predict honey production for the years in the dataset.
6. Predict future honey production using the trained model.

## Installation
To run this code locally, you'll need Python along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy scikit-learn
```
